# Microservices
Microservices are architectural style in which large & complex software applications are composed of one or more smaller services.

Microservices are design principles for an application

### Four main characteristics:

1. **Loosely Coupled:** The microservices are not tightly dependent on each other
2. **Small & Focused:** Each microservice focus on smaller & single task
3. **Language Neutral:** One microservice can be written in JAVA for performance benefits and other in Python for quicker deployment
4. **Bounded Context:** One microservice need not understand other microservices implementation
