# Microservices
Microservices are architectural style in which large & complex software applications are composed of one or more smaller services.

Microservices are design principles for an application

### Four main characteristics:

1. **Loosely Coupled:** The microservices are not tightly dependent on each other
2. **Small & Focused:** Each microservice focus on smaller & single task
3. **Language Neutral:** One microservice can be written in JAVA for performance benefits and other in Python for quicker deployment
4. **Bounded Context:** One microservice need not understand other microservices implementation

### Benefits of Microservices
- **Lowered learning curve:** No. of lines of code would be lesser and easier to understand services one by one
- **Scale bottlenecks:** When the load increases the services count can be increased to handle multiple requests
- **Quicker user acceptance testing:** Every microservice can be tested quickly since it is focused only on one smaller component of the entire software system
- **Quick to market changes:** Changes can be integrated to the services faster when compared to the monolithic approach
- **Business Alignment:** With the above factors microservices can adapt to the newer business requirement easily
